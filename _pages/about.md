I am a final year PhD candidate at Lancaster University under the supervision of Prof. David Leslie and Dr. Paul Rayson. My thesis develops information-theoretical Bayesian Optimisation for applications inspired by natural language processing. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of Statistics and Machine Learning, focusing mainly on Bayesian optimization. I leverage information-theoretic arguments to provide efficient and reliable optimisation for problems inspired by science and for hyper-parameter tuning tasks. My favorite application area is natural language processing (NLP), wherestate-of-the-art NLP systems pose particularly interesting tuning problems, as they can take days (if not weeks!) to train. I have practical experience in applying Bayesian optimisation to optimise real machine learning systems, including Amazon Alexa's text-to-speech pipeline, as detailed in publications at ICASSP and various Natural Language Processing conferences. 

Recently, I have developing BO for discrete structures, such as sequences, strings and trees, with a particular focus on applications in genomic and molecule design. By building convolutional kernels and evolutionary algorithms for structurally constrained spaces, I have derived BO architectures that can operate directly in the space of raw structures. This work has been carried out in collaboration with Dr. Javier Gonzalez (Microsoft Research). We are now building a system for biologists at Microsoft Research to accelerate synthetic gene design in their wet-lab experiments.
